                <h1>What is Coronavirus?</h1>
                <br>
                <h3>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
                    and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill
                    and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions
                    like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more
                    likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously
                    ill or die at any age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease
                    and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1
                    metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an
                    alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when itâ€™s your turn and follow local guidance.

                <blockquote>
                    In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province
                    , China. Pneumonia cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
                    Inoculation of respiratory samples into human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines,
                    led to the isolation of a novel respiratory virus whose genome analysis showed it to be a novel
                    coronavirus related to SARS-CoV, and therefore named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                    (SARS-CoV-2).

                    SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global
                    spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the
                    World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high
                    toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty.

                <h3>
                    A cluster of patients presented with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city of China was reported
                    to the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC) on 31, December 2019. Initial investigations identified
                    a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) as the etiological agent [9].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The infection was originated in Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan city of Hubei province and it
                    provided some link to an animal to human transmission through the sale of seafood and live animals [6,7].
                    Subsequently, the infection was noticed in increasing number of patients inside as well as outside the Wuhan
                    city, who did not have exposure to animal markets and this suggested person to person transmission [6,7].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The novel coronavirus was found to be highly contagious and has rapidly spread across the world within a span of
                    2-3 months. The number of COVID-19 related cases and deaths increased exponentially outside of China since the
                    beginning of March 2020 [11,12].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So far around 213 countries and territories have reported novel coronavirus cases
                    [12]. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization
                    declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [13]. Further, on February 19,
                    2020, WHO coined the term COVID-19 and declared this novel coronavirus disease as a pandemic on March 11, 2020
                    (Figure 2: Timeline in the key events of SARS-CoV-2) [1,10].
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As of June 8, 2020, more than 7 million cases and 400 thousand deaths were reported globally. The COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented human and health crisis
                    and the measures undertaken to contain the frightening pandemic has resulted in the global financial crisis.
